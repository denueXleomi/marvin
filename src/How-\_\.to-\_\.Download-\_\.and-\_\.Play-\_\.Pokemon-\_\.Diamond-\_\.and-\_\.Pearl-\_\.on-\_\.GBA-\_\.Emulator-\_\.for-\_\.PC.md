## What is a GBA emulator?
 
A GBA emulator is a software program that can imitate the Game Boy Advance (GBA) system and run its games on your PC. There are many GBA emulators available online, but one of the most reliable and popular ones is NO$GBA. It is open source, fast, and frequently updated. You can download NO$GBA from [here](https://retroemulators.com/games/pokemon-diamond-and-pearl-ds-download) [^1^].
 
## What is a Pokemon Diamond or Pearl ROM file?
 
A Pokemon Diamond or Pearl ROM file is a virtual version of the game that can be loaded into the emulator. You can think of it as a digital copy of the game cartridge. There are many websites that offer Pokemon ROMs for download, but you should be careful about the legality and safety of these files. Some of them may contain viruses or malware, or infringe on the copyrights of Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. One of the websites that claims to provide safe and legal Pokemon ROMs is [Visual Boy Advance](https://visualboyadvance.org/pokemon-roms/) [^2^]. You can browse their list of Pokemon ROMs and find Pokemon Diamond or Pearl.

## How to save your progress in Pokemon Diamond and Pearl on GBA emulator for PC?
 
Saving games on an emulator works differently than saving games on a console. The integrated save system of the game will not save your progress on the emulator. Instead, you will need to use the save state feature of the emulator. Here are the steps to follow:

1. When you want to save your game, click File > Save State and choose an empty slot.
2. You can save your game at any point you like, not only at the official checkpoints offered by the game.
3. When you want to resume your game from your saved state, click File > Load State and choose the slot where you saved your game.
4. The game will load from exactly where you left off.

That's it! You can now enjoy playing Pokemon Diamond and Pearl on your PC with a GBA emulator. Have fun!
